# Sign-Up System Documentation

## Overview

The **Sign-Up System** in the OrgaJobSearch application supports two primary user registration methods:

1. **Support Careers Sign-Up**: Allows admins to generate global invitation links with a JWT token containing an OTP.
2. **Candidate Sign-Up**: Allows support staff to generate individual invitation links for candidates with a JWT token containing a UUID.

This document provides a detailed explanation of these sign-up flows, including the API endpoints, JWT token structure, and validation processes.

## Sign-Up Flows

### 1. Support Careers Sign-Up Flow

- **Process**:
  1. An admin generates a **global invitation link** using the `/generate-url` endpoint. The link contains a JWT token with:
     - An **OTP** stored in the database with a type of `"GlobalInvitation"`.
     - An **expiration time** for security purposes.
  2. When a support career clicks the link, they are redirected to the sign-up page where the token is sent to the backend for verification.
  3. The backend verifies:
     - The OTP matches the one stored in the database.
     - The token has not expired.
  4. If verification is successful, the backend responds with the invitation type, and the frontend renders the appropriate sign-up form.
  5. The support career provides their email address and must verify it using another OTP sent via email to complete the registration.

### 2. Candidate Sign-Up Flow

- **Process**:
  1. Support staff generate an **individual invitation** by entering the candidate's email in a frontend form via the `/send-user-invitation` endpoint.
  2. The candidate receives an email with a sign-up link containing a JWT token with:
     - A **UUID** linked to the pre-registered candidate.
     - An **expiration time** for security.
  3. When the candidate clicks the link, the frontend sends the token to the backend for validation.
  4. The backend verifies:
     - The token has not expired.
     - The UUID exists in the database and matches a user who has not completed registration.
  5. If validation is successful, the frontend displays the candidate registration form, allowing the candidate to complete their sign-up.

## JWT Token Structure

### 1. Support Careers (Global Invitations)

The JWT token contains the following fields:

```json
{
  "otp": "otp123456",
  "type": "GlobalInvitation",
  "exp": 1698678600 // Expiration time (Unix timestamp)
}
```

- **`otp`**: The OTP generated for this invitation.
- **`type`**: Specifies the type of invitation (`"GlobalInvitation"`).
- **`exp`**: The expiration time of the token (in Unix timestamp format).

### 2. Candidates (Individual Invitations)

The JWT token contains the following fields:

```json
{
  "uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "type": "IndividualInvitation",
  "exp": 1698678600 // Expiration time (Unix timestamp)
}
```

- **`uuid`**: The UUID associated with the pre-registered candidate.
- **`type`**: Specifies the type of invitation (`"IndividualInvitation"`).
- **`exp`**: The expiration time of the token (in Unix timestamp format).

## API Endpoints

### 1. **Health Check**

- **Method**: `GET`
- **Path**: `/`
- **Description**: Verifies that the server is running and returns a success message.

### 2. **Authentication and Token Management**

- **`/login`**: Authenticates users and generates a JWT token upon successful login.
- **`/logout`**: Deconnection of users and delete the JWT token upon successful logout.
- **`/verify-token`**: Verifies the validity of tokens received from invitation links.

### 3. **Sign-Up and Invitation Management**

- **`/sign-up`**: Handles user registration based on the invitation type and token verification.
- **`/generate-otp`**: Generates an OTP for email verification during sign-up.
- **`/send-user-invitation`**: Allows support staff to invite candidates by sending an individual sign-up link.
- **`/generate-url`**: Admins generate a global invitation link for support careers.

### 4. **OTP Management**

- **`/send-otp`**: Sends an OTP to the userâ€™s email for verification.
- **`/verify-otp`**: Validates the OTP entered by the user.

## Security Measures

- **JWT Token Expiration**: Each token has an expiration time to prevent reuse after a set duration.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using a secure hashing algorithm and stored securely.
- **OTP Verification**: OTPs are stored in the database with expiration settings to confirm user identity during registration.

---

## Database and Data Handling

- **OTP Storage**: OTPs are stored with details like user type and expiration time.
- **UUID Registration**: UUIDs are pre-generated for candidates and linked to their email addresses in the database until they complete registration.
- **User Information**: User data is securely stored and only accessed during necessary validation processes.

---

## Additional Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for endpoints like `/login`, `/send-otp`, and `/sign-up` to prevent abuse.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure that critical endpoints are logged and monitored for suspicious behavior or errors.
